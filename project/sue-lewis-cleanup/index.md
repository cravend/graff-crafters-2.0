notes: There were a ton of weeds. Some taller than us and thicker than our thumbs. Because of this, no matter how we handled them, seeds would get shaken off the weeds and need a layer of preen. Due to the insane amount, we put down twice the recommended amount to keep seed germination of unwanted plants from coming up. Even after all that, weeds started popping out not even a week later. Immediately we got out there, and finished off the baby weeds through rigorous root cutting.
