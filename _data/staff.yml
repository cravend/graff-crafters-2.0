  position: Webmaster
  bio: Hi! My name is Dalton Craven. I'm an 11th grader at Mason High School. I've been interested in computers my whole life, and taking programming my freshman year helped me decide that was what I wanted to do. Right now, I'm the Finance Director and Webmaster for Mason Hack Club, as well as the Webmaster for Mason ACM. I'm also learning basic server management & web design through the Integrated Media Internship program. I've interned with the City of Mason's IT team & Various Views Research to get hands-on experience in real-life workplaces. Outside of school, I like working on my 1963 Mercury Comet, reading, and working at Kings Island.
